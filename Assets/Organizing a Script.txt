Editor Variables - any variable that can be edited in the editor goes here. variables here MUST have a tooltip
Non-Editor Variables - most class variables that should not be editable through the script. these should generally have comments describing their role

Script Specific Headers - these are custom headers for method groups that are specific to the particular class. for a player class, you may have a "Health" header or "Player Stats" header
